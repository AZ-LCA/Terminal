This is a project I'm taking on for fun to learn about system calls and gain more familiarity with assembly code.



Short term goals:

First to finish of the mvp portion for ls:

TODO: get user base directory for ~/
      stop showing hidden files / directories
      when lsing intoa made up dir do an error msg

Next I'll do the reach portion for ls. Start adding some flags

Later I'll stop auto-exiting the program when an unrecognised string is entered and instead make it such that typing 'exit' will exit the program

Long term goal is a fully functioning terminal that works on my computer that includes flags, built without any libraries.
